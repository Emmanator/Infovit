# Assignment 1
# it takes the list, sets total to zero and length to length of the input string
# starting with "a1b2c3", it sets total to 0 + 97 (unicode number of a) + 6 (length of the input string)
# next it goes to second position in the string which is the int "1", and sets total to (103 + 49 + 6)
# it continues doing so for each string in the list and for each string returns
# (total unicode value + 6(for each character) % 19
# It then prints the value returned being 5 9 16 6
